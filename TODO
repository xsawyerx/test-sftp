Organized according to how soon I think I will implement these.

** REWRITE **
    - Add port option
    - Update POD

* Upcoming versions:
    - Add testing for can_get and cannot_get using $remote_path as well
    - Check if we're uploading a file to where it really is right now, if so - prevent it
    - Set timeout for every action?
    - Add SKIP {} for connection-requiring methods
    - Provide "examples/" folder.
    - Check kwalitee issues
    - Check on functions that need the object is the object exists, fail automatically if it doesn't, with proper diag()
    - After running prove -Ilib t/03-successfuls, the prompt is still caught.

* Not any time soon, if at all:
    - Add tests for every possible connection success or fail (wrong host, missing attributes, timeout, etc.)
    - Allow different SFTP engines (Net::OpenSSH?)
    - Consider patching Net::SSH::Perl to pass taint mode so Test::SFTP's testing suite could include taint mode
    - Use an SSH server to be able to test the module in a more controlled manner
