NAME
    Test::SFTP - An object to help test SFTPs

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::SFTP;

        my $t_sftp = Test::SFTP->new(
            host     => 'localhost',
            user     => 'sawyer',
            password => '2o7U!OYv',
            ...
        );

        $t_sftp->can_get( $remote_path, $local_path, "Getting $remote_path" );

        $t_sftp->can_put(
            $local_path,
            $remote_path,
            "Trying to copy $local_path to $remote_path",
        );

VERSION
    This describes Test::SFTP 1.05.

DESCRIPTION
    Unlike most testing frameworks, *Test::SFTP* provides an object oriented
    interface. The reason is that it's simply easier to use an object than
    throw the login information as command arguments each time.

ATTRIBUTES
    Most attributes (at least those you can set on initialization) are
    read-only. That means they cannot be set after the object was already
    created.

        $t_sftp->new(
            host     => 'localhost',
            user     => 'root'
            password => 'p455w0rdZ'
            debug    => 1     # default: 0
            more     => [ qw( -o PreferredAuthentications=password ) ]
            timeout  => 10    # 10 seconds timeout for the connection
        );

  host
    The host you're connecting to.

  user
    Username you're connecting with.

    If you do not specify this explicitly, it will use the user who is
    running the application.

  password
    Password for the username you're connecting with.

    If you do not specify this explicitly, it will try other connection
    methods such as SSH keys.

  debug
    This flag turns on verbose for *Net::SFTP::Foreign*.

  more
    SSH arguments, such as used in *Net::SFTP::Foreign*, *Net::OpenSSH* or
    plain OpenSSH.

  timeout
    This turns on both connection timeout (via *-o ConnectTimeout=$time*)
    for ssh and a timeout for every data request.

    It is recommended to set a timeout, or the test might hang for a very
    long time if the target is unavailable.

  Sensitive Attributes
    connected
        A boolean attribute to note whether the *Net::SFTP::Foreign* object
        is connected.

        Most methods used need the object to be connected. This attribute is
        used internally to check if it's not connected yet, and if it isn't,
        it reconnect.

        You can use this attribute to check whether it's connected
        internally in your test script or run it using
        *$t_sftp->is_connected* as a test.

        However, try not to set this attribute.

    "$t_sftp->object($object)"
        This holds the object of *Net::SFTP::Foreign*. It's there to allow
        users more fingergrain access to the object. With that, you can do:

            is(
                $t_sftp->object->some_method( ... ),
                'Specific test not covered in the framework',
            );

        Please refer to Net::SFTP::Foreign for all the attributes and
        methods it supports.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  $t_sftp->can_connect($test_name)
    Checks whether we were able to connect to the machine.

  $t_sftp->cannot_connect($test_name)
    Checks whether we were not able to connect to the machine.

  $t_sftp->is_status( $string , $test_name )
    Checks the status code returned from the SFTP server.

    This is practicely the FX2TXT.

  $t_sftp->is_error( $string , $test_name )
    Checks for a certain SFTP error existing.

  $t_sftp->can_get( $remote, $local, $test_name )
    Checks whether we're able to get a file from $remote to $local.

  $t_sftp->cannot_get( $remote, $local, $test_name )
    Checks whether we're unable to get a file from $remote to $local.

  $t_sftp->can_put( $local, $remote, $test_name )
    Checks whether we're able to upload a file from $local to $remote.

  $t_sftp->cannot_put( $local, $remote, $test_name )
    Checks whether we're unable to upload a file from $local to $remote.

  $t_sftp->can_ls( $path, $test_name )
    Checks whether we're able to ls a folder or file. Can be used to check
    the existence of files or folders.

  $t_sftp->cannot_ls( $path, $test_name )
    Checks whether we're unable to ls a folder or file. Can be used to check
    the nonexistence of files or folders.

DIAGNOSTICS
    You can use the object attribute to access the *Net::SFTP* object
    directly.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    Some tests in the module require creating and removing files. As long as
    we don't have complete control over the environment we're going to
    connect to, it's hard to know if we're gonna upload a file that perhaps
    already exists already. We try hard to avoid it by creating a file with
    a random number as the filename.

    So, in previous versions (actually, only 1), these tests were mixed with
    all the other tests so if you had set the environment variable to
    testing, it would test it with everything. If you don't, it would not
    test a bunch of other tests that aren't dangerous at all.

    To ask for this to be tested as well, set the environment variable
    TEST_SFTP_DANG.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    This module should be incompatible with taint (-T), because it use
    *Net::SFTP* that utilizes *Net::SSH::Perl* that does not pass tainted
    mode.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    This module will have the same limitations that exist for *Net::SFTP*.
    Perhaps more.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-test-sftp at
    rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Test-SFTP>. I will be
    notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on your
    bug as I make changes.
